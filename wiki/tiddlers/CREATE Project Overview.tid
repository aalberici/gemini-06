Hardware and software Requirements
The application is a web server based application, using a LAMP stack as a favourite environment. Although it could be based in a Windows server, we highly recommend a Linux OS (Debian, Ubuntu Server, CentOS).
The preferred versions: Apache 2.1 MySQL 5.3 and PHP 5.5 (last stable LAMP stack).
MySQL has no limit on the number of tables. The underlying file system may have a limit on the number of files that represent tables. Individual storage engines may impose engine-specific constraints. InnoDB permits up to 4 billion tables.
Anyhow there is a relational connection between the nr of records, the performance of the system and the MySQL Database.
We recommend a 4GB RAM as a minimum memory requirement, along with a highly responsive Hard Disk. The best being an SSD disk of minimum 120GB.
The processor should be at least a Quad Core, or a 8 virtual core machine.
