!! DESCRIPTION
The business entity dedicated to contacts.

This is a normal vtlib module which can be installed through the module manager.  It contains a set of fields and information about your contacts. The Last Name field can be accessed by the user accessing the application as a means to extend the information we have about each contact that is linked to coreBOS.

Contacts are people with whom you communicate, either in pursuit of a business opportunity or for personal reasons.
The Contacts module represents an electronic replacement of your address book.You can find phone numbers, email addresses and other entries about a contact.
