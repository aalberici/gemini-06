The user interface (UI) is a set of configuration and programming steps based on prompts, actions, and information to be given to, or taken from, a user. The UI is designed in such a way that the user does not need any special knowledge to complete a particular task. It should also be easy for the user to understand, as well as intuitive so that they do not have to stop and think about what they are doing.
The user interface design phase is the process of defining the form, content, and behaviour of a product in order to provide its users with a coherent set of interactions that can be applied throughout the product.
UX designers need to make sure that the interface works well, is easy to learn and is fun to use. They also get feedback from users during testing phases so they can continue to improve the user experience over time.
