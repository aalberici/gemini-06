Embark on a journey through Evolutivo's innovative Credit and Debt Collection process, which offers a seamless and efficient management of invoices and due payments. Our platform's ingenious functionality caters to all aspects of this process, beginning with the charging function.

Our charging function determines the total amount owed by the customer for each event as soon as they perform an action, thus triggering an event. With the complex nature of modern-day product offerings, automating the charging function to the fullest extent possible becomes imperative, and that's precisely what we've accomplished at Evolutivo.

Next, we take you to the billing function, the crux of Billing and Revenue Management. This is where all the charges in a customer's balance are gathered and compiled into a bill. Our system operates on a billing cycle that is typically monthly or when the customer's balance reaches a specified amount. The bill, or the amount due, is automatically sent to the customer as a payment request.

Our platform's standout feature is its seamless integration with any ERP, creating a dynamic and efficient Balance Management system. Here, we effectively manage the customer balance, which is the amount that the customer owes or has been credited with. We meticulously accumulate all charges in the customer account, which are then consolidated into a bill. As soon as the customer's payment is received, the balance amount is promptly updated to reflect the new balance. Notably, every customer account comprises one or more balance groups that accurately record the customer's financial assets.

Lastly, we offer an advanced customer management module to round off our services. Each customer is assigned an account that encompasses all their information, ranging from their name and contact details to their service status, charge offers, customer balance, and payment methods. Our system is designed to provide an all-inclusive view of every customer's account, ensuring that you have all the necessary data at your fingertips. With Evolutivo's Credit and Debt Collection process, the management of invoices and due payments is streamlined, efficient, and user-friendly.
