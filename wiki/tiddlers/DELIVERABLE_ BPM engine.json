The use of a BPM product is preferable for processes that require high integration and/or complexity. When using BPM products, one must make sure not to build a monolithic application within it. Our BPM products are moving towards a deployment model based on microservices.\nWorkflow' itself is often an overloaded term that can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. A simple system may include:\n\n*  Task management - think of a to-do list for the user.\n*  Notifications - alerts the user via e-mail or text messages.\n*  Status management - the status of an item, e.g. not started, in progress or completed.\n*  Low number of users in a single group - no coordination between teams or departments\n\nA complex workflow system may include in addition to the above:\n\n* Numerous groups/users: spanning multiple departments or divisions\n* Multiple workflow levels: various branches and paths\n* Exception paths, recalls - error management and referrals to previous stages based on conditions\n* Case management - ad hoc investigative activities that are not predictable; may use one or more workflows depending on conditions.\n* Integration with rules - if/then logic for business or policy decisions\n* Integration with system orchestration - combination of a human workflow and a system workflow\n\nThe Business Process Management (BPM) product we are going to build can start with visual modelling and execution of business processes. It also offers the possibility of further integration capabilities with various adapters.\nThe BPMN language/specification is an industry standard for business process modelling. It allows business analysts to create business processes in a single application and deliver them to technology partners for implementation. There are three different industry-standard modelling notations: BPMN, DMN and CMMN. The extension of our BPM products supports some combination of these notations. From an industry standard notation perspective, BPMN was published in 2004, CMMN in 2014 and DMN in 2015. \nOur notation model starts with the definition of a DSL for describing the process, but it is linked to the step database to have a more direct relationship between state change and action execution. We are currently planning to incorporate support for CMMN using another DSL.\n\nWith the in-process/embedded mode, the BPM engine runs as part of the application, on the same operating application. This guarantees high performance, makes scalability a little more difficult, but this problem can also be overcome.\nIn addition, we decided to introduce a standalone (we would say 'headless') mode into the project, which allows the BPM engine to be deployed as a standalone service, without penalising performance but allowing interactions with external applications.\n\nThe specific aspect we decided to give our BPM solution is to run an integrated business rules management system, known as Business Maps. Business Maps uses about 20 different engines and 4-5 DSL specifications, for validations, regexes, escalation rules (DMNs).\n\nEvolutivo is investing heavily in workflow and flow processing, an on-premise queue management that supports reactive messaging (Kafka) and the use of serverless workflows. It is a highly scalable process orchestrator, easily integrated with Clickhouse for analysis and with Integromat for external activities.\n\n\n",
