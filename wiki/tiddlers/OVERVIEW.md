Built on the solid LAMP stack, this platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools to digitalize CRM processes, enabling businesses to engage with customers effectively, enhance the customer experience, and achieve greater business success.

## Platform Modules and Features

- Increases flexibility and customization of data storage.

### Mapping System
A mapping system with over 20 types of business maps is integrated into the platform to map out various aspects of a company's processes. In CRM, these maps visualize customer journeys, sales pipelines, customer service workflows, enhancing comprehension and management of these processes.

#### Implications:
- Enhances understanding and visualization of CRM processes.
- Increases efficiency and customer satisfaction.

#### Implications:

### Sales Force Automation Module

### Helpdesk Module
While it seems there has been an error with the text provided for the helpdesk module (it repeats the sales module), the general purpose of a helpdesk module in a CRM system would typically involve providing efficient and organized customer support management. Such a module would allow businesses to track, prioritize, and resolve customer support tickets in a systematic and timely manner.

#### Implications:
- Enhances customer support management.
- Increases customer satisfaction and loyalty.

By leveraging Evolutivo's CRM platform, businesses can not only manage, but also nurture and grow their customer relationships, leading to increased loyalty, satisfaction, and overall business success.
