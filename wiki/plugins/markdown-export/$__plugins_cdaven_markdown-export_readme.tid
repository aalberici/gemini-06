!! What is this?

This is a plugin for ~TiddlyWiki that lets you export tiddlers to Markdown, either in the web browser or on the command line.

On the command line, you can use the [[tool installable via npm|https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiddlywiki]] and type something like this:

```sh
tiddlywiki <folder> --render <tiddler> '[encodeuricomponent[]addsuffix[.md]]' 'text/plain' '$:/plugins/cdaven/markdown-export/md-tiddler'
```

!! Wait, //which// Markdown?

There are quite a few different Markdown specifications, and I have settled on [[Pandoc Markdown|https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown]], for two reasons:

# Pandoc Markdown is quite capable, with a lot of extensions. All of these extensions will not work in every Markdown renderer, but most will.
# [[Pandoc|https://pandoc.org]] itself is a great way to convert from (Pandoc) Markdown to other document formats, such as Word or PDF.

!!! Further conversion with Pandoc

You can convert a Markdown file to Word with this simple Pandoc command:

```
pandoc -o output.docx input.md
```

Simply change ".docx" to ".html" or ".pdf" to convert to other formats, or use [[the --to switch|https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--to]].

You can also convert this Pandoc Markdown file to CommonMark or GitHub-Flavored Markdown like this:

```
pandoc -o common.md --to commonmark input.md
pandoc -o github.md --to gfm input.md
```

!! Some caveats

Since ~TiddlyWiki is very expressive -- and has a multitude of plugins -- export plugins such as this probably cannot support all possible variations.

Converting to Markdown requires a bunch of compromises, and will therefore be "opinionated". This is how //I// want my Markdown to look.

!! Encoding

The Markdown file will be encoded with UTF-8 and Linux/Mac newlines (still works on Windows!). This should work on most platforms and with most third party applications.

!! System Requirements

The plugin uses relatively modern Javascript ("ES2015") that doesn't work in Internet Explorer. Most modern browsers //should// work.
